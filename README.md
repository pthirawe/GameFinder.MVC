The Game Finder App is a team project where we are building an ASP.NET Web App that enables users to keep track of live concerts.

The app consists of a database with tables for:
- Games
- Genres
- Features
- Ratings
- Developers
- Publishers
- Platforms
- Vendors

In the current version, users will have the ability to:
- Add games, genres, developers, publishers, features, and vendors to the database.
- Rate videogames.
- List and Filter Games by title, genre, developer, and publisher.
- List data from each table.
- Update game, genre, developer, publisher, platform information.
- Link games to multiple genres, features, and vendors.

For future development, planned features include:
- Additional search functionality.
- Import data from external source.
- User roles to allow search without account creation
- Improved user interface.

The goals of this project are:
- Practice the fundamentals of agile workflow
- Demonstrate proficiency in constructing ASP.NET web applications.
- Construct application making use of the MVC pattern.
